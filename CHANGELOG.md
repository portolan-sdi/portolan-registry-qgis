# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Registry discovery now uses `portolan-python`. Release ZIPs include that dependency under the QGIS plugin root.

### Added

- A layer that fails to open shows GDAL's reason. A missing codec, such as LERC in the QGIS Flatpak, names the codec and what to do.
- Registry panel with text, status, and map-extent filters. Each catalog shows a map of its extent and its logo.
- Catalog page with the catalog tree, collection icons, thumbnails, details, and an asset list with format badges.
- Pages of 25 catalogs and 50 tree entries.
- PMTiles vector tile layers styled with the collection's MapLibre style.
- GeoParquet layers through DuckDB, limited to the map extent by default.
- COG, GeoJSON, and FlatGeobuf layers over HTTP.
- Downloads that keep the catalog layout and verify `file:checksum`.
